Differences between Nu data model and VGA Planets
==================================================

  (This deals with the 'rst' object only)


  beamspec.dat ("beams"), torpspec.dat ("torpedoes"), and engspec.dat
  ("engines") are pretty standard.

  hullspec.dat ("hulls") does not contain a picture Id, instead, the
  client synthesizes a picture name using the hull Id.

  "hulls" also contains a "cancloak" field. The other hull functions
  are hard-coded.

  truehull.dat is not transmitted; instead, "racehulls" contains only
  this player's hulls.

  Players are numbered from 1, and owners are given as player Ids. 
  Each player maps to a race. It is unclear how an "all-Feds" game
  would work as they would all map to the same race and thus the same
  name.

  The "ships" section is used for both "ship.dat" and "target.dat".
  It has the following differences:
  - waypoints are stored in absolute form (targetx, targety), not dx/dy.
  - missions are 0-based (0=explore, 1=mine sweep, 2=lay mines, ...),
    not 1-based.
  - the Tow mission stores its parameter in the same slot as the
    Intercept mission (mission1target).
  - there can be only a ship/ship or ship/planet transfer at a time,
    not both. This matches the planets.exe GUI restriction, but not
    the file format as implemented by 3rd party. The type is
    identified by the transfertargettype field (1=planet, 2=ship).

  The "planets" section is used for "pdata.dat", "xyplan.dat", and
  "planet.nm". It has the following differences:
  - invisible planets are not transmitted (i.e. their names are not
    known)
  - the temperature is stored as-is, not 100-x.

  The "starbases" section is used for "bdata.dat".
  - Bases are addressed by a base Id, which has no relation to a
    planet Id; the planet Id is an attribute of the base.
  - The ship to build is identified by a hull number, not a truehull
    slot.
  - A ship build is triggered by the "isbuilding" property. A base
    can store a ship assembly with isbuilding=false (a ship in BDATA
    will always be built).
  - Base storage is organized as "stock" (another top-level object).
    Each stock is a tuple of (starbaseid, stocktype, stockid, amount,
    builtamount, id), with
    . starbaseid being the base (not planet!) Id
    . stocktype is 1 for hulls, 2 for engines, 3 for beams, 4 for
      launchers, and 5 for torpedoes
    . stockid is the item Id (hullspec/engspec/beamspec/torpspec
      index)
    This means, a base can theoretically store and build ships not
    in truehull.

  The "gen.dat" file can be assembled from various pieces. A
  timestamp can be obtained by reformatting the settings.hoststart
  value normally in format "8/12/2011 9:00:13 PM".

  Messages have a messagetype, a headline and a body. The messagetype
  can produce a "(-xNNNN)<<< foo >>>" line together with the target
  field, the headline is used as "From: ...", and the body contains
  the actual text, with embedded HTML. In addition, messages contain
  x,y, which can be used to produce explosion markers (messagetype 10).
  Like HOST, Nu is not consistent in marking messages; messagetype 8
  is used for exploration ("There are no enemy colonists....") with
  target being a planet Id, and for gather missions, with target being
  a ship Id.

  All special friendly codes are lower-case/case-insensitive.

  Nu tracks undoable actions by counting supplies sold, torpedoes
  built, etc. However, there is no ability to find out the real
  "beginning of turn" value of most properties.

  The VCR is almost compatible to Tim-VCR, it uses arithmetic rounding
  ("0.5 rounds up") instead of banker's rounding ("0.5 rounds towards
  nearest even").

  Number of fighters in combat is computed differently. For planet
  without base:
  - Host: fighters, bays := round(sqrt(planetDefense))
  - Nu:   fighters := round(sqrt(planetDefense - 0.75))
          bays     := trunc(sqrt(planetDefense))
  These are the formulas from the client. A planet with 21 DP has
  4 bays/4 fighters in NuHost (5/5 in Host), which is evidence that
  the "round" actually is "ERND" (banker's rounding).

  Maximum structures is computed differently. The general formula is
      maxStructures := clans                         if clans <= limit
                       limit + round(clans - limit)  otherwise
  (with limit=50 for defense, 100 for factories, 200 for mines).
  Host uses ERND, PHost uses Round, which makes no difference in
  practice. Nu uses Trunc and thus allows fewer buildings.
  
  Fuel-Usage: It seems that NU calculated the usage of fuel as Phost. (Nonproven, experimantal)
